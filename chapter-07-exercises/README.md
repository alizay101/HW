Alizay Tries -------
  
v1 <- c(4, 5, 6, 7)
v2 <- c(8, 9, 10, 11, 12)

Alizay Tries --------

  Need to try this again !!!! 

Alizay Tries -------
  
(v1 +v3)/(v1+v1)

v4 

v1

v4

v6 <- c(1, 4, 6)
v7 <- c(8, 9, 10)

v6
v7

Alizay Tries ----
  
locations <- c("building", "lake", "river")


band <- paste(colors, locations, sep = "") # returns "Greensky" "Bluegrass

together <- paste(song, locations, sep = "")

band <- paste(song, locations, sep = "")
